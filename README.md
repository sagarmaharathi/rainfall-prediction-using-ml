# rainfall-prediction-using-ml
Rainfall prediction is a crucial component of weather forecasting, especially
for agriculture, disaster prevention, and water resource management Traditional
I forecasting methods often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear patterns in
i weather data. This project leverages machine learning(ML)techniques to build a
I predictive model for rainfall using historical meteorological data. Key features
I such as temperature,humidity,wind speed,and atmospheric pressure are collected
I and preprocessed. Various ML algorithms including Linear Regression,
I Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines are trained and
I evaluated to determine the most accurate model. The models are assessed using
I performance metrics such as accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and RÂ²
I score. Our findings show that ML models, particularly ensemble methods like
I Random Forest, outperform traditional approaches in predicting rainfall.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in handling
I complex environmental data and provides a foundation for more accurate and
I timely rainfall forecasts.
